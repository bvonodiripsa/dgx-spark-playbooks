Abstract

The  functional  effects  of  genetic  variants  associated  with  complex  diseases  exhibit  pronounced  spatiotemporal
specificity. Although spatially resolved studies have advanced, their temporal dynamics remain poorly characterized.
Here, we present an analytical framework integrating developmental gene expression with genome-wide association
studies to decipher age-specific windows during which genetic variants exert their effects and to elucidate underlying
mechanisms. Applying this framework to five major neuropsychiatric disorders, we uncover a fundamental principle:
the  peak  incidence  of  a  disease  precisely  coincides  with  the  developmental  window  of  peak  expression  of  its
associated risk genes in the prefrontal cortex. These risk windows are characterized by distinct biological processes;
for instance, childhood risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder aligns with a peak in presynaptic machinery
gene  expression,  whereas  late-life  risk  for Alzheimer‚Äôs  disease  corresponds  to  heightened  immune-related  gene
activity. Leveraging this principle of temporal convergence significantly improves the prioritization of disease genes.
Our work establishes the developmental basis for the age of onset of complex diseases, providing a temporal roadmap
for understanding disease mechanisms and developing age-appropriate therapeutic strategies.

Introduction

The effects of genetic variants are governed by a fundamental spatiotemporal context, manifesting only when their
target  genes  are  expressed  at  the  right  time  and  in  the  right  place1-3. While  immense  progress  has  been  made  in
mapping  the spatial context  of  disease  risk  from  tissues  to  single  cells4-8,  the temporal dimension  remains  poorly
resolved. Understanding how the pathogenic effects of genetic risk factors are deployed across the human lifespan is
a critical unanswered question in human genetics.

The  importance  of  this  temporal  dimension  is  particularly  striking  in  neuropsychiatric  disorders,  which  are
characterized  by  distinct,  age-specific  windows  of  onset9.  Elucidating  the  mechanisms  that  determine  this  age-
dependent  susceptibility  is  not  only  crucial  for  understanding  pathogenesis  but  also  for  developing  timely
interventions  that  can  improve  outcomes10,11.  Yet,  systematically  mapping  this  temporal  landscape  has  been
intractable. This endeavor has been hindered by the historical scarcity of high-resolution transcriptomic data spanning
human  development  and,  critically,  by  the  lack  of  analytical  frameworks  capable  of  integrating  dynamic  gene
expression patterns with summary-level data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Here, we bridge this gap by developing an analytical framework to systematically resolve the age-specific windows
of genetic risk for complex traits. We integrate developmental gene expression dynamics from the human prefrontal
cortex with large-scale GWAS for five major neuropsychiatric disorders. Through this approach, we aim to identify
the critical developmental epochs of disease vulnerability, characterize the specific biological programs active within
them, and establish a new temporal dimension for prioritizing disease genes.

Results

A framework to resolve the temporal dynamics of disease risk

We began by addressing the hypothesis that the distinct ages of onset for neuropsychiatric disorders are driven by the
temporal  dynamics  of  risk-gene  expression.  To  test  this,  we  developed  tDESE  (temporal-specific  Driver-tissue
Estimation by Selective Expression), an analytical framework designed to integrate developmental transcriptomics
with GWAS data to pinpoint critical windows of disease risk (Fig. 1). The core challenge in this endeavor is to distill
true developmental signals from noisy, post-mortem human brain expression data.

Our first step was therefore to construct robust, high-resolution expression trajectories for each gene across the human
lifespan. We  proposed  a  generalized  additive  model  (GAM)  to  two  independent  prefrontal  cortex  developmental
datasets, a method chosen for its flexibility in capturing complex, non-linear relationships. This approach allowed us
to  model  gene  expression  as  a  continuous  function  of  age  while  statistically  controlling  for  key  technical  and
biological  confounders,  such  as  RNA  quality  and  sex. The  result  was  a  set  of  smoothed  expression  profiles  that
represent the dynamic activity of thousands of genes.

With these trajectories established, we next sought to quantify the temporal specificity of each gene's expression,
aiming to identify the precise window of its peak activity. We computed a relative expression Z-score (REZ) for each
gene at yearly intervals, which effectively transforms its expression curve into a profile of its functional importance
over time. The final and central component of tDESE involves integrating these temporal specificity profiles with

GWAS summary statistics for a complex disease. Extending our previous DESE method5, tDESE employs a powerful
iterative procedure that refines the set of putative disease-associated genes, substantially enhancing the signal-to-
noise ratio. This analysis yields a statistical enrichment score for each developmental time point, pinpointing specific
ages  where  the  expression  of  disease-associated  genes  is  most  significantly  concentrated,  thereby  revealing  the
putative temporal origins of disease pathology.

Figure 1 | Schematic overview of the tDESE analytical framework. tDESE integrates age-resolved developmental
transcriptomic data and disease GWAS summary statistics to identify temporally specific enrichment of genetic risk.
The  output  consists  of  year-by-year  enrichment  scores  and  adjusted  P-values  for  disease  association  across
developmental ages. The framework comprises three major steps: (1) Temporal modeling of gene expression. For
each gene, tDESE fits a generalized additive model (GAM) to capture the relationship between expression and age,
while adjusting for potential confounders (Covs). Partial dependence analysis is used to estimate the marginal effect
of age on expression after controlling for covariates, generating smoothed, high-resolution expression trajectories

potential  biases  introduced  by  the  iterative  scheme,  100  permutations  of  the  expression  matrix  are  performed  to
construct a null distribution of enrichment scores, from which corrected P-values are derived. See Methods for full
details.

Simulations confirm the accuracy and specificity of tDESE

To rigorously validate the statistical performance of tDESE, we conducted extensive simulations using real genotype
data  from  the UK Biobank12.  We  first  challenged  the  framework  under  a null  model,  in  which  the  expression of
susceptibility  genes  had  no  temporal  component.  As  required  for  a  robust  method,  tDESE  produced  no  spurious
signals  of  enrichment.  Across  100  simulations,  the  mean  enrichment  scores  fluctuated  at  a  low  baseline,  rarely
exceeding a value of 1.5 and showing no discernible trend across the lifespan (Fig. 2a). While a small fraction of
individual simulations (4%) yielded a stochastically significant result (adjusted P <0.05) at isolated time points, these
hits failed to coalesce into any coherent temporal pattern, confirming that the framework's type I error rate is well-
controlled and that it is robust against false positives arising from noise.

Having  established  this  high  specificity,  we  next  tested  tDESE's  power  to  resolve  a defined  temporal  signal. We
simulated a binary disease trait (3,000 cases, 3,000 controls) where genetic risk was driven by 250 genes (contributing
25% heritability) whose expression peaked sharply at age 20. The framework resolved this simulated risk window
with  remarkable  precision  and  power.  The  resulting  profile  of  mean  enrichment  scores  formed  a  sharp,  high-
amplitude  peak  that  precisely  mirrored  the  underlying  expression  trajectory  of  the  driver  genes,  soaring  from  a
baseline near zero to a mean score greater than 12 at the epicenter of the risk window (Fig. 2b). This signal was both
strong and temporally localized. All 100 simulations returned a highly significant result (adjusted P <0.05), with
significant enrichment being tightly confined to the peak and its immediately adjacent years (age 20 ¬± 3 years), a
pattern consistent with the high temporal correlation of gene expression.

Finally, to assess the framework's versatility, we applied it to a more complex and statistically challenging continuous
trait within a cohort of 6,000 individuals, with risk driven by an expression peak of 250 genes (contributing 25%
heritability) at age 60. Even in this scenario, tDESE successfully identified the simulated risk window. It generated
a clear and statistically significant enrichment profile accurately centered on age 60, which displayed the highest
average enrichment score (mean = 7.28) (Fig. 2c). As expected for a quantitative trait, the resulting enrichment profile
was broader and of lower amplitude than in the binary case, and the statistical power was more modest (66%), yet
the signal remained unambiguous. Substantial enrichment was consistently detected in the immediately adjacent ages
(58‚Äì62), while time points outside the 50‚Äì70 year window showed none. Collectively, these simulations establish
that tDESE robustly and accurately links the genetic architecture of both categorical and continuous traits to specific
developmental epochs.

Temporal  windows  of  genetic  risk  for  neuropsychiatric  disorders  align  with  clinical

onset

Having validated tDESE, we applied it to uncover the temporal origins of genetic risk for five major neuropsychiatric
disorders  with  well-characterized  onset  profiles:  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)13,  schizophrenia
(SCZ)14, major depressive disorder (MDD)15, bipolar disorder (BIP)16, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD)17. These were
selected for their pronounced age-specific incidence9,18 and the availability of large-scale GWAS (N > 225K per trait).
The  analysis  was  conducted  using  two  independent  developmental  transcriptomic  datasets  from  the  dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), referred to as LIBD_szControl and CMC assembled in the PsychENCODE project19 (see
Methods for details). The prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in higher-order cognitive functions and undergoes
prolonged  maturation  during  adolescence  and  adulthood,  a  period  highly  relevant  to  the  etiology  of  various
psychiatric conditions19. The datasets offered complementary age coverage, with LIBD_szControl comprising 253
samples from birth to age 71, and CMC comprising 283 samples from age 17 to 90 (Supplementary Fig. 1); and all

samples were non-neuropsychiatric controls.

A foundational step was to resolve true developmental signals from the high inter-sample variability inherent in post-
mortem tissue. We performed UMAP visualization and pairwise sample correlation analysis on the raw expression
data. Samples with similar chronological ages did not exhibit clear expression similarity, indicating high inter-sample
variability  (Fig.  3a,c;  Supplementary  Fig.  2a,c),  likely  due  to  tissue  heterogeneity  and  inter-individual  variation
masking age-dependent trends. In contrast, smoothed expression trajectories generated by GAM fitting displayed
clear age-continuous clustering (Fig. 3b,d; Supplementary Fig. 2b,d), validating tDESE‚Äôs ability to isolate marginal
age effects on gene expression.

This approach revealed a striking concordance between the windows of peak genetic risk enrichment and the known
clinical age-of-onset for each disorder. For ADHD, a classic childhood-onset disorder, the LIBD_szControl dataset
identified a significant enrichment peak for genetic risk at age 15 (adjusted P = 0.04), falling squarely within the
reported diagnostic window of 8‚Äì18 years9 (Fig. 3e). In the CMC dataset, no significant ADHD-associated age was
detected (Fig. 3f), likely due to the absence of samples younger than 17 years, thereby limiting the detection of early
developmental signals.

In  contrast,  disorders  emerging  in  early  to  mid-adulthood  showed  highly  concordant  risk  windows  across  both
independent datasets. For SCZ, tDESE identified a significant risk window spanning ages 30‚Äì35 in LIBD_szControl
(peak enrichment score = 19.5, adjusted P < 0.01) and 28‚Äì35 in CMC (peak enrichment score = 17.6, adjusted P <
0.01), both aligning precisely with its established onset period of 21‚Äì35 years9 (Fig. 3e,f). A similar high degree of
consistency was observed for MDD, with significant windows at 24‚Äì33 years in LIBD_szControl and 28‚Äì33 years
in CMC, and for BIP, with windows at 26‚Äì32 years in LIBD_szControl and 26‚Äì31 years in CMC. For both disorders,
the peak enrichments were highly significant (adjusted P < 0.01) and consistent with their respective clinical onset
ranges9.

Finally,  we  examined Alzheimer‚Äôs  disease,  a  canonical  late-onset  neurodegenerative  disorder.  The  results  again
underscored the framework's temporal specificity. No signal was detected in the LIBD_szControl cohort, whose age
range does not extend into the primary AD risk period. However, in the CMC cohort, tDESE identified a clear, late-
life risk window, with enrichment scores escalating sharply after age 80 and peaking at age 89 (adjusted P < 0.01)
(Fig. 3f). This finding directly mirrors epidemiological data, such as a meta-analysis reporting a rise in AD prevalence
in China from 1.3% at ages 65‚Äì69 to 18.5% at ages 85‚Äì8920.

Taken  together,  our  analysis  establishes  a  direct  and  robust  link  between  the  developmental  timing  of  risk-gene
expression  and  the  age-specific  clinical  manifestation  of  five  distinct  neuropsychiatric  disorders.  The  findings
demonstrate  that  genetic  risk  is  not  a  static  property  but  a  dynamic  process,  one  that  is  activated  within  specific
temporal windows to shape the brain‚Äôs vulnerability to disease.

Disease risk windows reveal distinct biological programs

Having identified these disease-specific risk windows, we sought to define the biological processes active within
them. We developed a temporal correlation analysis to identify "temporally sensitive genes," referring to genes whose
expression trajectories are highly correlated with a disorder's tDESE enrichment profile (see Methods). Functional
analysis  of  these  genes  revealed  that  each  risk  window  is  characterized  by  a  distinct  and  functionally  coherent
biological program.

Gene Ontology  (GO) enrichment  analysis  of  the  top  200  temporally  sensitive  genes  for  each  disorder  revealed a
fundamental divergence between the psychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions (Fig. 4a). For ADHD, SCZ, MDD,
and  BIP,  the  most  significantly  enriched  Cellular  Component  term  was  uniformly  synapse,  establishing  synaptic
biology as a shared cornerstone of their temporal risk21-23. In stark contrast, the late-life risk window for Alzheimer's
disease was dominated by genes involved in the inflammatory response (Biological Process, adjusted P = 2.6 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ),
consistent with the well-established role of neuroinflammation in its pathogenesis24.

Within  the  overarching  synaptopathy  of  the  psychiatric  disorders,  the  specific  biological  processes  were  distinct.
ADHD's early-life window was most significantly enriched for anterograde trans-synaptic signaling (adjusted P =
6.8 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬≤). The adult-onset disorders also centered on synaptic transmission, but with different emphases: trans-
synaptic signaling was the top term for both SCZ (adjusted P = 5.3 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∏) and BIP (adjusted P = 1.3 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬≤), while
MDD  was  defined  by  modulation  of  chemical  synaptic  transmission  (adjusted  P  =  3.3  √ó  10‚Åª‚Å∂),  reinforcing  the
synaptopathy model across these conditions21,23.

To resolve these synaptic signatures with higher spatial precision, we used the SynGO database25, revealing a clear
divergence  in  the  implicated  synaptic  compartments  (Fig.  4b).  The  ADHD  risk  window  was  characterized  by
temporally sensitive genes enriched in both presynaptic (adjusted P = 1.1 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥) and postsynaptic (adjusted P = 2.3
√ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥) components. In contrast, the risk windows for SCZ, MDD, and BIP were all dominated by a much stronger
enrichment for postsynaptic genes. For SCZ, the postsynaptic enrichment (adjusted P = 3.2 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞) was five orders
of magnitude more significant than the presynaptic one (adjusted P = 2.2 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åµ). This marked postsynaptic skew
was also observed for MDD (adjusted P = 2.3 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬π vs. 9.9 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∑) and BIP (adjusted P = 1.2 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬≤ vs. 3.9 √ó 10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞).
This  suggests  a  pathogenic  model  where  distinct  synaptic  vulnerabilities  are  engaged  at  different  developmental
stages.

These overarching signatures are exemplified by the expression dynamics of individual, high-confidence risk genes
(Fig. 4c). The ADHD risk window aligns with the adolescent peak expression of ARHGEF7, which encodes Œ≤-PIX,
a key regulator of Rac1/Cdc42 GTPases essential for dendritic spine formation26. For SCZ, the risk window coincides
with  the  peak  expression  of  ATP2A2,  which  encodes  the  calcium  pump  SERCA2,  a  critical  regulator  of  the
intracellular calcium signaling implicated in the disorder27. Similarly, the MDD and BIP risk windows align with the
peak expression of genes crucial for synaptic plasticity (LRFN5)28 and neuronal excitability (KCNB1, encoding the
Kv2.1  channel)29.  Finally,  the  late-life  risk  for AD  is  marked  by  peak  expression  of  VAC14,  part  of  the  PIKfyve
complex  essential  for  PI(3,5)P‚ÇÇ  biosynthesis  and  lysosomal-autophagic  function,  whose  disruption  causes
neurodegeneration30.

In  summary,  this  integrative  analysis  identifies  temporally  sensitive  genes  that  orchestrate  age-specific  biological
processes.  These  findings  provide  a  new  temporal  dimension  for  understanding  disease,  moving  from  broad
synaptopathy to specific compartmental and molecular vulnerabilities that underpin the age-specific manifestation of
neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

onset window. Analyses for ADHD, SCZ, MDD, and BIP used the LIBD_szControl dataset; AD analysis used the

Temporal risk profiles are sexually dimorphic

Given the known sex differences in the prevalence and onset of many psychiatric disorders, we investigated whether
tDESE  could  resolve  sex-specific  temporal  risk  profiles. We  stratified  the  analysis  for  SCZ,  MDD,  and  BIP,  the
disorders with sufficient sample sizes for this finer-grained test. The analysis revealed a consistent pattern of earlier-
emerging genetic risk windows in males compared to females across all three disorders (Fig. 5a).

For SCZ, we identified a significant risk window for females between ages 31 and 38 (peaking at 35, adjusted P <
0.01), whereas males showed an earlier, suggestively significant window at ages 29‚Äì30 (adjusted P = 0.07). This 3-
to-5-year lag in the female risk profile is highly consistent with long-standing epidemiological observations of a later
age of onset for SCZ in women31,32. A similar temporal shift was observed for BIP, where a significant male risk
window from 26 to 30 years (peak at 28, adjusted P < 0.01) preceded the female window of 28 to 37 years (peak at
32, adjusted P <  0.01). This  again  aligns  with  clinical  reports  of  earlier  onset  in  males,  particularly  for  Bipolar  I
disorder33.

For  MDD,  tDESE  also  identified  an  earlier  male  risk  window  at  24  to  30  years  (peak  at  26, adjusted  P <  0.01),
followed by a later and more prolonged female window at 27 to 38 years (peak at 34, adjusted P < 0.01). This finding
contributes to a complex literature on sex differences in MDD onset9,34.

Crucially, these sexually dimorphic risk profiles were mirrored by the expression dynamics of temporally sensitive
genes (Fig. 5b). In SCZ, for instance, the expression of MYO5A shows an earlier rise and peak in males that coincides
with  their  earlier  risk window.  Likewise,  the  expression  trajectories  of ATP2A2 in MDD  and KCNB1 in BIP both
show earlier up-regulation in males, providing a potential molecular basis for the earlier emergence of genetic risk.

Together, these analyses suggest that sex differences in the clinical manifestation of  psychiatric disorders are not
merely a clinical phenomenon but may be rooted in sexually dimorphic timing of developmental gene expression
programs within the prefrontal cortex. While these findings require validation in larger, sex-stratified cohorts due to
the reduced statistical power of this sub-analysis, they demonstrate the remarkable ability of our temporal framework
to resolve fine-grained, clinically relevant patterns of disease risk.

The temporal architecture of genetic risk extends to cognitive and behavioral traits

To determine if the principle of temporally-specific genetic risk extends beyond clinical disorders, we applied tDESE
to four major cognitive and behavioral traits: neuroticism (NEU)35, smoking behavior (SMK)36, sleep duration (SD)37,
and  intelligence  (IQ)38.  This  analysis  revealed  that  these  traits  are  also  characterized  by  distinct  developmental
windows of genetic enrichment, primarily concentrated in adolescence and early adulthood (Fig. 6a).

Neuroticism was unique in displaying a bimodal risk profile, with a significant adolescent peak at age 14 and a second,
larger peak in early adulthood at age 24 (adjusted P < 0.01). Sex-stratified analysis revealed a complex and divergent
temporal pattern: the adolescent peak appeared earlier in females, while the adult peak emerged significantly earlier
in males (age 23 vs. 34 in females, adjusted P < 0.01) (Fig. 6b). This developmental "cross-over" suggests that the
genetic  pathways  influencing  neuroticism  are  activated  with  different  sex-specific  timing  across  maturation.  In
contrast,  SMK  and  SD  showed  significant  enrichment  windows  in  early  adulthood  (peaks  at  ages  32  and  32,

respectively), and both displayed the earlier male enrichment pattern seen in the psychiatric disorders (Fig. 6b). The
genetic architecture of IQ was also temporally localized, with a significant enrichment window at ages 31‚Äì36, but
showed no significant sex differences.

To evaluate the temporal concordance between cognitive/behavioral traits and psychiatric disorders, we computed
Spearman correlations between their genome-wide enrichment curves across all ages (Fig. 6c). NEU displayed high
correlation with ADHD (r = 0.93) and MDD (r = 0.92), highlighting shared age-specific genetic architectures39-41.
SMK  was  most  strongly  correlated  with  BIP  (r  =  0.93),  supporting  a  shared  developmental  window  for  genetic
liability to bipolar disorder and addictive behaviors42. SD showed strong correlations with SCZ (r = 0.96), BIP (r =
0.95), and MDD (r = 0.92), implicating sleep-regulating pathways in the early developmental origins of multiple
psychiatric conditions. In contrast, IQ showed comparatively weaker correlations with all disorders (maximum r =
0.7), suggesting a more distinct genetic architecture.

Age-specific gene expression enhances the prioritization of known disease genes

We evaluated the performance of age-specific expression profiles for ranking known disease susceptibility genes.
Traditional  approaches  to  gene  annotation  often  rely  on  gene  expression  data  averaged  across  the  brain  or
developmental stages, potentially masking dynamic molecular signatures associated with specific windows of disease
vulnerability. To address this, we used age-specific gene expression levels at each age point to rank candidate genes
and evaluated the ability of each age-specific ranking to recover known disease-gene associations.  Benchmark
gene  sets  were  compiled  from  the  Open  Targets  Platform43,  including  genes  with  drug  target  evidence  or  high

integrative  scores  from  the  platform  (see  Methods  for  details).  The  prioritization  performance  at  each  age  was
quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

For all five neuropsychiatric disorders examined, the highest prioritization performance occurred near the age range
of peak disease vulnerability (Fig. 7): ADHD showed the best performance at age 25 (AUC = 0.77), SCZ at age 25
(AUC = 0.61), MDD at age 24 (AUC = 0.67), BIP at age 29 (AUC = 0.61), and AD at age 87 (AUC = 0.62). While
the optimal age for ADHD slightly deviated from its epidemiological peak onset, the overall trend suggests that gene
expression  profiles  during  high-risk  developmental  windows  more  effectively  capture  pathogenic  signals.  These
findings provide direct support for a key principle: genes with elevated expression during a disorder‚Äôs risk period are
more likely to be core contributors to disease pathogenesis. This reinforces the notion of an age-dependent genetic
architecture in psychiatric disorders and highlights the value of incorporating developmental timing into functional
annotation and disease gene discovery. Integrating age-specific expression profiles into future analyses may enhance
biological interpretability and improve the translational relevance of gene prioritization frameworks.

The timing of disease onset has long been a central mystery in medicine. Here we establish a fundamental principle
that helps resolve it: the genetic risk for major neuropsychiatric disorders is activated within specific developmental
windows that coincide with the peak expression of associated risk genes. This work moves beyond the prevailing
spatially  dominated  view  of  genetic  risk,  recently  advanced  by  spatial  transcriptomics8,44,  to  introduce  a  critical
temporal dimension. By integrating developmental transcriptomics with large-scale GWAS, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability of a tissue to disease is not static, but is a dynamic property defined by its age-specific functional state.
This is exemplified by the alignment of ADHD risk with a period of intense presynaptic maturation and AD risk with
an epoch of heightened neuroimmune activity.

Our temporal framework provides a new lens through which to interpret the shared and divergent biology of these
disorders.  It  refines  the  broad  "synaptopathy"  model  of  psychiatric  illness23  by  revealing  that  different  synaptic
compartments are implicated at different life stages: a balanced pre- and post-synaptic vulnerability in childhood-
onset ADHD gives way to a predominantly postsynaptic vulnerability in adult-onset disorders like schizophrenia.
This  temporal  resolution  provides  a  potential  mechanistic  basis  for  their  distinct  clinical  presentations  and
developmental trajectories. By showing that the same tissue, the prefrontal cortex, can harbor the latent risk for vastly
different disorders, our findings underscore that the biological context conferred by age is as critical as the context
conferred by anatomy.

A key implication of our work is that the common practice of using static or time-averaged expression data to interpret
genetic risk may obscure the most critical pathogenic signals. We provide direct, quantitative evidence for this by
showing  that  the  ability  to  prioritize  known  causal  genes  and  drug  targets  is  itself  temporally  specific,  peaking
precisely within the disease-relevant age window. This provides a data-driven strategy for enriching GWAS follow-
up studies and for identifying the most promising targets for age-appropriate therapeutic intervention, addressing a
key challenge in post-GWAS analysis45.

Our study has limitations that define clear next steps. The temporal transcriptomic datasets, while the best available,
are of modest size, and the sex-stratified analyses, though revealing, will require validation in larger cohorts. The
observed  sexually  dimorphic  risk  profiles,  however,  are  consistent  with  known  differences  in  brain  development
driven by the temporal regulation of gene expression by sex hormones46. Our analysis is currently focused on the
prefrontal  cortex;  extending  this  framework  to  other  tissues  and  a  broader  range  of  complex  diseases  as  new
longitudinal  datasets  emerge  will  be  a  critical  future  direction.  Finally,  while  our  approach  identifies  powerful
temporal  associations,  establishing  definitive  causality  is  a  major  challenge  in  genomics7,8.  Recognizing  these
constraints underscores the importance of integrating richer temporal datasets and causal inference strategies to fully
realize the potential of time-aware approaches in elucidating complex disease mechanisms.

tDESE framework

Overview

The  temporal-specific  Driver-tissue  Estimation  by  Selective  Expression  (tDESE)  framework  integrates  temporal
gene expression dynamics with GWAS data to identify putative critical developmental windows underlying disease
onset and the key genes. By evaluating the age-specific expression patterns of genes linked to disease-associated

genetic variants, tDESE pinpoints temporal intervals during which genetic risk may exert maximal influence. Built
upon our previously developed DESE framework, tDESE replaces tissue-specific expression profiles with temporally
resolved expression data. However, the key challenge is to address inter-sample variability inherent to developmental
transcriptomics  for  a  smooth,  high-resolution  expression  trajectory,  preferably,  at  single-year  granularity.  The
variability can be caused by a series of confounding factors, such as uneven sampling density across ages, large inter-
sample  variability,  and  non-linear  expression  changes.  Therefore,  we  developed  a  generalized  additive  model
(GAM)-based  smoothing  strategy. This  approach  enables  robust  estimation  of  gene expression  trajectories  across
ages under high-noise conditions, thereby providing a refined signal for identifying developmentally specific genetic
risk windows.

The  core  tDESE  workflow  consists  of  three  sequential  steps:  (1)  Smoothing  age-dependent  gene  expression
trajectories to predict expression levels for each year of age. (2) Calculating the time-specific expression of each gene.
(3)  Integrating  age-specific  expression  profiles  with  GWAS  data  using  the  DESE  framework  to  identify  disease-
associated ages.

Data input

The inputs to tDESE include GWAS summary statistics, temporal gene expression data, and genotype data from a
reference population. For each sample in the temporal expression dataset, the exact age in years is recorded together
with relevant covariates, including sex and RNA integrity number (RIN).

Expression trajectory modelling and prediction

Because our study focuses on age-dependent dynamic changes in gene expression, we first applied the trimmed mean
of M-values (TMM) method to normalize raw expression values across samples, ensuring comparability between
samples. As gene expression changes with age are not linear, we used a smoothing approach to model the relationship
between gene expression and age. To account for non-age-related sources of variation, sex and RIN were included as
covariates in the model. Notably, when modelling was performed separately by sex, sex was naturally excluded as a
covariate. tDESE fits a GAM model for each gene individually:

After model fitting, we used partial dependence analysis to extract the marginal effect of age on gene expression
while controlling for covariates. We then predicted expression values for each integer age, from the minimum to the
maximum  sample  age,  to  generate  a  smoothed  expression  trajectory  at  one-year  resolution  together  with  the
corresponding  95%  confidence  interval  and  standard  error  (SE),  which  were  used  to  assess  the  stability  and
uncertainty  of  the  estimates.  This  step  reduces  noise  while  preserving  the  authentic  signal  of  temporal  dynamic
changes as much as possible.

Calculation of age-specific expression

To quantify the expression specificity of genes across different ages, we employed the robust-regression z-score (REZ)
method5. The core concept of this method is to measure the relative expression level of a gene at a given age, defined
as its standardized difference compared with other ages. REZ uses robust regression to reduce the influence of outliers,
thereby improving the stability of the estimates. In addition, the standard error of expression is incorporated as an
indicator of uncertainty, enabling a more reliable representation of the age specificity of gene expression.

Linking disease risk to age

We next used the tDESE framework to integrate age-specific gene expression profiles with GWAS summary statistics
for each disease, to decipher ages of elevated disease risk. In the original DESE framework, tissue-specific expression
profiles are used as input; here, they were replaced by age-specific expression profiles. For a given GWAS dataset,
DESE  first  calculates  gene-based  association  P-values using  the  ECS  statistical  model47,  based  on  the GWAS  P-
values  of  SNPs  located  within  1  kb  upstream  or  downstream  of  each  gene.  We  then  selected  significant  genes
(Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg adjusted P < 0.01; if more than 1,000 genes met this criterion, only the top 1,000 by P value
were retained) for conditional gene-based association analysis. Specifically, genes were ranked by their gene-based
association  P  values,  and  conditional  gene-based  association  analysis  was  performed  to  remove  redundant
associations, yielding a set of independently associated genes.

For each age, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess whether the age-specific expression of the independently
associated genes was higher than that of other genes. The base-10 negative logarithm of the test P-value was defined
as the disease enrichment score, which indicates the gene-level association significance of age-specific expression
and  the  disease  risk.  Based  on  these  enrichment  scores  and  the  selective  expression  profiles  of  genes,  disease-
associated  genes  were  re-prioritized,  assigning  higher  priority  to  genes  with  high  specific  expression  at  disease-
enriched ages. Conditional association analysis was then repeated to obtain a new set of disease genes and updated
enrichment scores. This procedure was iterated until the results converged.

Because the iterative procedure can introduce potential selection bias for the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, DESE employs
a permutation-based global test (maxT permutation test) to estimate the null distribution. Specifically, the age labels
in the input age-specific expression profiles are randomly permuted B times (100 by default). For each permutation,
the analysis is repeated, and the maximum enrichment score (max-ES) across all ages is recorded. These max-ES
values form the empirical distribution under the null hypothesis and are used to directly evaluate the significance of
the  observed  statistics.  For  each  age,  the  permutation  P-value  is  defined  as  the  proportion  of  values  in  the  null
distribution that are greater than or equal to the observed statistic:

  denotes the maximum enrichment score across all ages in the

Here,
-th permutation. Because this approach
compares the observed statistic with the global maximum from each permutation, the resulting P-values inherently
control the family-wise error rate (FWER) and require no additional multiple-testing correction.

no age-specific expression (i.e.,
proportion of the 100 simulations that yielded a P-value < 0.05. To assess statistical power, we simulated data
under the alternative hypothesis, where the 250 susceptibility genes followed the age-dependent expression patterns
described above. Power was calculated as the proportion of the 100 simulations in which tDESE detected a
significant association (P < 0.05) at the designated peak age.

GWAS summary statistics

We collected GWAS summary statistics from public databases for five well-studied neuropsychiatric disorders with
distinct  age-of-onset  patterns:  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  schizophrenia  (SCZ),  major
depressive  disorder  (MDD),  bipolar  disorder  (BIP),  and  Alzheimer‚Äôs  disease  (AD).  We  also  included  four
psychological or behavioral traits: neuroticism (NEU), smoking (SMK), sleep duration (SD), and intelligence (IQ).
These disorders and traits have large sample sizes, with an average of 442K individuals, ensuring sufficient statistical
power for the analyses (see Supplementary Table 1 for details). In all analyses, the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) region was excluded to avoid confounding from its complex linkage disequilibrium structure.

Developmental dynamic gene expression profiles

RNA-seq  datasets  from  LIBD_szControl  and  CommonMind  (CMC)  were  obtained  from  the  PsychENCODE
project19  (http://www.psychencode.org/).  Only  healthy  postnatal  individuals  with  samples  from  the  dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex were included in the current study. Only samples with an RIN greater than 6 were retained to ensure
RNA  integrity. To  reduce  the  impact of  sparse  sampling  at  the  extremes  of  the  age distribution,  which  can  cause
boundary bias and unstable estimates in the GAM, we applied an age-based trimming procedure before analysis.

Specifically, samples were first sorted by age, and a fixed width sliding window (default width = 5 years) was applied
from each end of the age axis to identify the first interval meeting the minimum sample size criterion (default ‚â•5
samples). The boundaries of these intervals were then used as the start and end points for retention, and only samples
within this age range were included in subsequent analyses. This step ensured adequate local sample density at the
youngest and oldest ages, thereby stabilizing the local smoothing process in GAM, reducing variance in tail estimates,
and improving the reliability of trend and derivative estimates.

In  the  actual  data,  the  LIBD_szControl  dataset  originally  spanned  ages  0‚Äì85  years (N=259), which,  after  quality
control, ranged 0‚Äì71 years (N=253). The CMC dataset originally spanned ages 17‚Äì90 years (N=284), with no change
in range or sample size after quality control. For each dataset, genes were retained for downstream analysis if they
had non-zero expression in at least five samples, based on the raw count data.

Age at diagnosis from epidemiological surveys

For  four  psychiatric  disorders,  namely  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder,  schizophrenia,  major  depressive
disorder  and  bipolar  disorder,  we  referred  to  a  large-scale  meta-analysis  of  epidemiological  studies  on  mental
disorders9 to obtain the interquartile range (Q1‚ÄìQ3) of the age-at-onset distribution, which was taken as the peak age
range for each disorder. For Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, as the vast majority of cases occur after the age of 65 years18, we
adopted the conventional definition of 65‚Äì100 years as its high-risk age range.

Identification  of  time-sensitive  genes  at  high-risk  disease  ages  and  functional

enrichment analysis

To identify genes specifically highly expressed during disease high-risk age periods, we calculated the Spearman‚Äôs
rank correlation coefficient between each gene‚Äôs expression levels across different ages and the disease enrichment
scores at corresponding ages. A higher correlation coefficient indicates stronger age-specific expression of the gene
during  the  disease  high-risk  period.  Genes  with  the  highest  correlation  coefficients  were  defined  as  ‚Äútemporally
sensitive genes‚Äù at high-risk disease ages. In subsequent analyses, the top 200 temporally sensitive genes ranked by
correlation coefficient were selected for functional enrichment analysis, including both the general Gene Ontology
(GO) database and the SynGO database focused on synaptic function.

GO  enrichment  analysis  was  performed  using  the  API  provided  by  g:Profiler  (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler)49,
selecting three GO categories: Biological Process (GO:BP), Cellular Component (GO:CC), and Molecular Function
(GO:MF). Enrichment significance was assessed by Fisher‚Äôs exact test, and multiple testing correction was applied
using  the  default  g:SCS  algorithm.  SynGO  enrichment  analysis  was  conducted  via  the  SynGO  online  platform25
(https://www.syngoportal.org/), using Fisher‚Äôs exact test for significance and false discovery rate (FDR) correction
for multiple testing.

Sex-specific analysis of disease-associated ages

We  stratified  the  developmental  dynamic  expression profiles  by  sex and  performed  tDESE  analysis  separately  to
identify sex-specific high-risk ages for disease. Due to insufficient female samples under the age of 35 in the CMC
dataset after sex stratification, these samples did not pass quality control (see Supplementary Figure 1), and therefore,

this dataset was not used for sex-stratified tDESE analysis. In the LIBD_szControl dataset, the reduced sample size
after sex stratification led to a loss of statistically significant enrichment signals for some diseases.

Similarity analysis of high-risk age patterns across phenotypes

To assess the similarity of high-risk age patterns among different phenotypes, we calculated the Spearman‚Äôs rank
correlation  coefficient  between  enrichment  scores  of  each  phenotype  across  different  ages. A  higher  correlation
coefficient indicates a stronger concordance between two phenotypes in their high-risk age patterns.

Gene prioritization and evaluation based on age-specific expression

To  evaluate  whether  prioritizing  disease  risk  genes  based  on  age-specific  expression  during  peak  disease  ages
improves  gene  prioritization  performance,  we  ranked  disease-associated  genes  according  to  their  specificity  of
expression at each age. Disease-associated genes were defined as those with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P values
below 0.01. If more than 1000 genes met this threshold, only the top 1000 genes by P-value were retained.

Next, we constructed a benchmark disease gene set using the Open Targets Platform (release 25.06)50, which is a
comprehensive tool supporting the systematic identification of potential therapeutic targets and their prioritization.
For  our  benchmark,  we  selected  genes  with  an  overall  association  score  ‚â•0.4,  reflecting  moderate  or  higher

aggregated evidence, as well as genes with drug evidence recorded in ChEMBL (ChEMBL score >0). The union of
these two sets was used as a high-confidence reference set for disease genes. Based on this benchmark, we performed
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for gene prioritization
at each age. This evaluation assessed the accuracy of gene prioritization at different ages and identified the age at
which prioritization performance was optimal.

Data availability

GWAS  summary  statistics  for  the  five  neuropsychiatric  disorders  were  obtained  from  the  Psychiatric  Genomics
Consortium  (PGC,  https://pgc.unc.edu/for-researchers/download-results/),  and  those  for  four  psychological  and
behavioral  traits  were  obtained  from  the  GWAS  Catalog  (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/).  Developmental  dynamic
expression data for the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were retrieved from the PsychENCODE project19 via
NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Genotype data for the European population from Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project
were  downloaded  from  ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/release/20130502.  Benchmark  disease  genes
were  obtained  from  the  Open  Targets  Platform  (https://platform.opentargets.org/).  In  the  simulation  study,  the
