## Feasibility of Supporting Missing Features

The current architecture could support some missing features with extensions:

**Possible with moderate changes**:
- Hybrid search by adding sparse retrieval components
- Reranking by adding a relevance scoring layer
- Multi-turn conversations by extending the query context model

**Requiring significant architecture changes**:
- Multimodal support would require new document processors, extractors, and models
- GPU acceleration would require replacing Pinecone with Milvus+cuVS
- Computer vision components would need entirely new processing pipelines

**Recommended approach**: Integrate with NeMo Retriever NIMs (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) for specific capabilities rather than rebuilding them. The modular design of txt2kg would allow selective integration of NeMo components like reranking and vision models where needed.

## Technology Used in NVIDIA NeMo Retriever

**NVIDIA Technology**:
- NeMo Retriever Llama 3.2 Embedding NIM
- NeMo Retriever Llama 3.2 Reranking NIM
- Llama 3.1 70B Instruct NIM
- NeMo Retriever Page Elements NIM
- NeMo Retriever Table Structure NIM
- NeMo Retriever Graphic Elements NIM
- PaddleOCR NIM
- NeMo Retriever Parse NIM (optional)
- Llama 3.1 NemoGuard 8B Content Safety NIM (optional)
- Llama 3.1 NemoGuard 8B Topic Control NIM (optional)
- Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct NIM (optional)
- Mixtral 8x22B Instruct 0.1 (optional)

**3rd Party Software**:
- LangChain
- Milvus database (accelerated with NVIDIA cuVS)

**Hardware Requirements**:
- Docker: 4xH100 or 6xA100
- Kubernetes: 9xH100 or 11XA100
- Alternative to use NGC-hosted models with one GPU for cuVS-accelerated vector database

## Integration Opportunities

The txt2kg platform could be enhanced through targeted integration with key NVIDIA NeMo Retriever components:

1. **Multimodal Support**: Integrate NeMo Retriever Page Elements, Table Structure, and Graphic Elements NIMs to handle complex document types.

2. **Enhanced Retrieval**: Add the NeMo Retriever Reranking NIM to improve retrieval quality beyond the current local filtering approach.

3. **Content Safety**: Implement NemoGuard NIMs for content moderation and topic control in enterprise settings.

4. **Vector Database Acceleration**: Migrate from Pinecone to Milvus with cuVS for GPU-accelerated vector search.

5. **Vision Capabilities**: Add support for the Llama 3.2 Vision model to enable image understanding within documents.
